### Events

**Events** are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming
— the system will fire a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and also provide
a mechanism by which some kind of action can be automatically taken (e.g. some
code running) when the event occurs.


For example in an airport when the runway is clear for a plane to take off, a signal is
communicated to the pilot, and as a result they commence piloting the plane.

In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be
attached to a specific item that resides in it — this might be a single element, set of
elements, the HTML document loded in the current tab, or the entire browser window.

There are a lot of different types of event that can occur, for example:
 + The user clicking the mouse over a certain element, or hovering the cursor over
a certain element.
+ The user pressing a key on the keyboard.
+ The user resizing or closing the browser window.
+ A web page finishing loading.
+ A form being submitted.
+ A video being played, or paused, or finishing play.
+ An error occurring.

There are three ways to perform events:

+ Event handler properties

+ Inline event handlers

+ addEventListener() & removeEventListener()
