 ### Variables

 Variables are used to store data, they are placeholders for concrete values.

 Using a variable requries the following two steps :-

+ Declare a varaiable
+ Initialize it, that is, give the value

To declare a varaible, it uses **var** keyword

]`var a;`
`var thisIsAVariable;`
`var _and_this_too;`
`var mix12three;`


For the name of the variables, you can use a combination of **letters, numbers, the underscore character, and the dollar sign**.

However, you can't start with a number, which means the following declaration of code is invalid:

`var 2three4five;`     ***invalid declaration***


To initialize a variable means to give it a value for the first(inital) time. The following are the two ways to do:

+ Declare a variable first, then intialize it     
`var name;`    
`name = 'Naveen';`

+ Declare and initialize it with a single statement    
`var name = 'Naveen';`



**Variables** names are **case sensitive**

`var Name = 'Naveen'` 

`var name = 'naveen'`


here if `console.log(Name);` the output is **Naveen**   
and for this `console.log(name);` the output is **naveen**
