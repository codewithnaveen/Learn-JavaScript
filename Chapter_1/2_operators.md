#### Operators

**Operators** take one or more values(or variable), perform an operation, and return a value.

For example : `1 + 2;` the output is 3

In the preceding code:

+ The + symbol is the operator
+ The operation is addition
+ The input values are 1 and 2 (they are also called opernds)
+ The result value is 3.
+ The whole thing is called expression.

Instead of using the values 1 and 2 directly in the expression, you can use variables.

`var a = 1;`

`var b = 2;`

`a + 1;` it results into 2 

You can also variable to store the result of expression  `var c = a + b;` 


|**Opertaor**|**Operation**|**Example**|**Output**|
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
|+| Addition |`1 + 2;`|`3`|
|-| Subtraction|`99.99 - 11;`|`88.99`|
|*| Multiplication |`2 * 3;`|`6`|
|/| Division |`6 / 4;`|`1.5`|
|%| Modulo |`5 % 3;`|`2`|
|++| Increment a vaue by 1 |`var a = 123;`  `var b = a++;`|`now b is 123 and a is 124`|
|--| Decrement a vaue by 1 |`var a = 123;`  `var b = a--;`|`now b is 123 and a is 122`|


The `var a = 1;e ` is also an operation, It's the simple assignment operation, and = is the **simple assignment operator**.


There is also a family of operators that are a combination of an assignment and arithmetic operator. These are called **Compound operators**.

`var a = 5;`

`a += 3;`

`console.log(a);` the output is **8**
